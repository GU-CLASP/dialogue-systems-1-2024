* How to deploy your app

1. Use SSH to login to eduserv.
2. Create a folder in =/srv/www/= with the same name as your gus-account, e.g. =gusxxxxxx=.
3. Build your app: =yarn build --base=gusxxxxxx=, this will produce a =dist= directory with a few files in it. (More information can be found in [[https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html][Vite documentation]]).
4. Copy the contents of this directory to your folder on the server:
   #+begin_src sh
   scp -r dist/* eduserv:/srv/www/gusxxxxxx/
   #+end_src
5. Access your app at https://eduserv.flov.gu.se:9000/gusxxxxxx (protected by password).
